* Explanation
	> In the figure above, I took Q49 (What is your edu. leve?) and used it as my rows to cross it with Q25 (Would you dedicate 2 hours a month to volunteer?) as my columns. I then took a count of the values from Q39 (Would you be a part of a block group or block watch?), which are the numbers displayed in the actual table. In the second figure, it simply showing the result values as percentages of the rows, i.e. percentage of each degree with their corresponding values. 

* Analysis
	> In the pivot tables, the split is pretty similar among all values in the columns with the 'Yes' column containing around %59 and the 'No' column containg around %28. The remaining %10 falls into the 'Don't Know' column. This shows that regardless of education level, the community feels approximately the same among the opinion of a watch party. Now the opinion of the community toward a block watch seems to be more in favor than not having a block watch. From this we can see that the general attitude this community has towards its infrastructure is positive, and they want to see an improvement upon it.

* Explanation
	> In these two pivot tables, the only difference between them is the column section.The first table used Q25(Would you dedicate 2 hours of community service?) and the second table used Q34(Are you willing to participate in community planning?), each question was used for columns in their respective table. Also, the only other difference from the original table, the first two tables shown, is the row section is using Q12(How would you rate your neighborhood?), instead of Q49.

* Analysis
	> These two tables are very very similar in their approach, stated in the explanation, 

3. Inquire into patterns that exist in respondents ideas for changes to make in Hazelwood (Q6). Would creating sub-planning groups for neighborhood improvements based on age and gender makse sense to you based on the data? Is there a connection between the improvements folks would like to see and the Creative activities folks are interested in (Q29)?

4. To what degree are folks who indicate that they have special skills more likely to be willing to volunteer in the community (Q25)?
"People who live in larger households (more people) tend to be happier" says the policy maker in Hazelwood. What can the survey data bring to bear on this assertion? What weaknesses exist in the data limiting their ability to contribute insight to this question?

5. A town council member suggests that people who own their own home are more "community minded" than those who rent. A recently elected council person disagrees and claims that folks who rent their home are more likely to work lower wage jobs, allowing less time for community engagement. Can the survey data shed insight into this division of thought?
