# Visualize Yourself: A Job's Repercussions on Mood & Energy #

## Visuals ##

### Chart Notes ###
	> The layout for each chart follows the same pattern of being my rankings vs. my parents rankings.

## Analysis ## 

* Self
	> Looking at the charts for my specific rankings of my mood and energy, it appears that the difference between my mood and energy for my days off and working are not too different. Using the density chart, it shows that the days I had off had were slightly better than days where I worked. Also, looking at all of the charts, mostly the boxplot, it appears that the difference between both mood and energy for is around one ranking value which is not too significant. After all of this collection and visualization, it is clear that work does put a bit of a damper on both mood and energy, but not too much of a restraint.
* Parent
	> When looking at the parent measurements portion of the data, it almost mimics the data that I had collected pretty closely. Again viewing the density chart first, it is clear that on the days where I was off they viewed myself as more outgoing and being happier, but for the days where I had work, they clearly thought that I was less energized. Even though they thought my ladder statement was true, it did not appear to affect their opinion on my mood while I was working. Viewing the boxplots, it is almost shocking how similar the ones between my parents and I are, almost having identical metrics for each chart, which I found fascinating. 
* Conclusion
	> To answer the inquiry I had conjured up at the beginning of this project, I believe that work does put a damper my mood and physical states, but not a significant amount. It is what I had previously hypothesized would happen. Comparing it with what I had said with my parents, I was partially correct. On the days where I was off it showed better rankings than my own rankings, but I had a lower ranking on my mood when I was working vs. my parents view on my lower energy level on working days. In conclusion, the project has shown me how to interpret my own data to answer question that one may find difficult to prove without proof.
