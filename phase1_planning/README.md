# Visualize Yourself: A Job's Repercussions on Mood & Energy #

### Factor Model ###

## How much does working shifts at my job affect my mental and physcial states, mainly on mood and energy? ##

![Factor Model](https://github.com/eric-wisniewski/visualizeYourself_Project/blob/master/phase1_planning/SimpleFactorModel.png)

* Energy
	> Energy will be calculated into a score based on quantification scales used before, during, and after work. The times of the data collection will be randomized in the respective time frames previously metioned. It will also be used on days where there is no work taking place. My theory on energy levels is they will show a steady decline from the begininng to the end, varying of difficulty of work day. On the days where there is no work I feel 
* Mood
	> Mood will also be calculated like the former, and I predict that mood will decrease to the middle of the day, but then will increase due to the fact of the shift ending. 
* Outcome Variable
	> The outcome variable in this scenario will almost act as an index in the fact that scores from both Energy and Mood averaged will determine a rating for the three scores measured during the work days, and the results from the non-work days. 
* Outside Surveys
	> Although I am interested in my energy and mood levels, I am also curious as on how my parents view on my job affects me. So I have created two more surveys in which they will answer the same questions as myself. Their answers will be also taken into account to compare it with my own perception of my levels of mood and energy

### Rationale & Hypothesis ###

* Rationale
	> When presented the opportunity to obtain data about myself, it got me thinking as to what it would be. Since I'm also working as the manager of a fast-food resturant at the time of this project, I figured I would tie that into data visualizaton. I've worked there for three years, and trust me sometimes it gets a little wild there. I was curious as to how my basic mood and energy levels felt at that time, so I decied I would make this project. Also with a great idea from Mr. Darsow, I also have taken into account how my parents would believe my levels are, and to compare it with my own view on the subject matter. 
* Hypothesis
	> I believe during this project I will discover that work does put a damper on both mood and energy, although I do not believe it will be drastically significant. I may also find that a job causes a drop in energy, more than mood, due to past experience at the establishment. I also predict that the days where there is no working involved the data may be a bit scattered. The data referring to the ranges of scores within self recorded survey. My beleifs on how my parents will view my energy and moods levels will be unkown until seen by myself. I believe that our views will be similar but might vary in a lower scaling level.
