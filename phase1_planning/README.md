# Visualize Yourself: A Job's Repercussions on Mood & Energy #

### Factor Model ###
![Factor Model](https://github.com/eric-wisniewski/visualizeYourself_Project/blob/master/phase1_planning/SimpleFactorModel.png)

* Energy
	> Energy will be calculated into a score based on quantification scales used before, during, and after work. Also will be used on days where there is no work taking place. My theory on energy levels is they will show a steady decline from the begininng to the end, varying of difficulty of work day. 
* Mood
	> Mood will also calculated like the former, and I predict that mood will decrease to the middle of the day, but then will increase due to the fact of the shift ending. 
* Outcome Variable
	> The outcome variable in this scenario will almost act as an index in the fact that scores from both Energy and Mood averaged will determine a rating for the three scores measured during the work days, and the results from the non-work days.
