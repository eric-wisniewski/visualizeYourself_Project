# Visualize Yourself: A Job's Repercussions on Mood & Energy #

## Beta Data Tool ##

* Surveys
	> For the bulk of my data collection in this project I will be using Google Forums. I have decided to create 4 surveys, each containing questions of energy and mood levels for both working and non-working days. Two of the surveys will correspond to my mood and energy. The other two surveys will give their incite to my mood and energy. There is a survey for A.M. and P.M.

* Timing
	> As to the time of collection of the data, i.e. the completion of each survey within it's respective time, I have yet to decide the exact tool to pick a correct time. I plan on using a tool on IOS that will have a timer go off within each time frame. The time frames I plan on using are 12am-12pm and 12pm-12am.

* Data Planning
	> The data will be collected within the forums over the duration of this project. It will then be exported with each respective survey in .csv format: all .csv files will be merged into one file then which will be operated upon. Which implies visual display in an option of ways which is not yet decided at the time of 10/5/2020.
