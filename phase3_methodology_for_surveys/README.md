# Visualize Yourself: A Job's Repercussions on Mood & Energy #

## Methodology ## 

> Inside this foler is the methodology for the surveys I have created for my parents and myself. The explanations for each choice can be found in the file I have linked within this phase folder. Each survey has a ranking of 1-5 with the days where I work vs. days that I am off from work. My parents will see the almost the exact same surveys that I do.
